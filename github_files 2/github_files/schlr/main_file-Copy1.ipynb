It has been known that an internally triconnected plane graph G of n vertices has a convex grid drawing on a grid of O(n 3) area if the triconnected component decomposition tree of G has at most four leaves. In this paper, we improve the area bound O(n 3) to O(n 2), which is optimal up to a constant factor. More precisely, we show that G has a convex grid drawing on a 2n脳4n grid.

A bandwidth consecutive multicoloring, simply called a b-coloring of G, assigns each vertex v a specified number b(v) of consecutive positive integers as colors of v so that, for each edge (v, w), all integers assigned to vertex v differ from all integers assigned to vertex w by more than b(v, w). The maximum integer assigned to vertices is called the span of the coloring. The b-coloring problem asks to find a b-coloring of a given graph G with the minimum span. In the paper, we present four efficient approximation algorithms for the problem, which have theoretical performance guarantees for the computation time, the span of a found b-coloring and the approximation ratio. We also obtain several upper bounds on the minimum span, expressed in terms of the maximum b-degrees, one of which is an extension of Brooks' theorem on an ordinary coloring.\",\n",

One wishes to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G so that the total weight of each component is at least l and at most u. Such an \"almost uniform\" partition is called an (l, u)-partition. We deal with three problems to find an (l, u)-partition of a given graph: the minimum partition problem is to find an (l, u)-partition with the minimum number of components; the maximum partition problem is defined analogously; and the p-partition problem is to find an (l, u)-partition with a given number p of components. All these problems are NP-hard even for series-parallel graphs, but are solvable for paths in linear time and for trees in polynomial time. In this paper, we give polynomial-time algorithms to solve the three problems for trees, which are much simpler and faster than the known algorithms.',\n",

Using a random deal of cards, pairs of card players (agents) can share information-theoretically secure keys that are secret from an eavesdropper. In this paper we first introduce the notion of an Eulerian secret key exchange, in which the pairs of players sharing secret keys form an Eulerian circuit passing through all players. Along the Eulerian circuit any designated player can send a message to the rest of players and the message can be finally returned to the sender. Checking whether the returned message is the same as the original one, the sender can know whether the message circulation has been completed without any false alteration. We then give three efficient protocols to realize such an Eulerian secret key exchange. Each of the three protocols is optimal in a sense. The first protocol requires the minimum number of cards under a natural assumption that the same number of cards are dealt to each player. The second requires the minimum number of cards dealt to all players when one does not make the assumption. The third forms the shortest Eulerian circuit, and hence the time required to send the message to all players and acknowledge the secure receipt is minimum in this case.',\n",

However, the algorithm and the variants including Bharat's improved HITS, abbreviated to BHITS, proposed by Bharat and Henzinger cannot be used to find related pages any more on today's Web, due to an increase of spam links. In this paper, we first propose three methods to find “linkfarms,” that is, sets of spam links forming a densely connected subgraph of a Web graph.

Combining the three methods and the trust-score algorithm with BHITS, we obtain several variants of the HITS algorithm. We ascertain by experiments that one of them, named TaN+BHITS using the trust-score algorithm and the method of finding linkfarms by employing name servers, is most suitable for finding related pages on today's Web.

      "{'input_text': ' In our earlier work, we found that feature space induced by tactile receptive fields (TRFs) are better than that by visual receptive fields (VRFs) in texture boundary detection tasks. This suggests that TRFs could be intimately associated with texture-like input. In this paper, we investigate how TRFs can develop in a cortical learning context. Our main hypothesis is that TRFs can be self-organized using the same cortical development mechanism found in the visual cortex, simply by exposing it to texture-like inputs (as opposed to natural-scene-like inputs). To test our hypothesis, we used the LISSOM model of visual cortical development. Our main results show that texture-like inputs lead to the self-organization of TRFs while natural-scene-like inputs lead to VRFs. These results suggest that TRFs can better represent texture than VRFs. We further analyzed the effectiveness of TRFs in representing texture, using kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) and the results, along with texture classification performance, confirm that this is indeed the case. We expect these results to help us better understand the nature of texture, as a fundamentally tactile property.', 'pos_extraction': ['earlier', 'feature', 'tactile', 'receptive', 'better', 'visual',

      "{'input_text': ' User-based collaborative filtering systems suggest interesting items to a user relying on similar-minded people called neighbors. The selection and weighting of these neighbors characterize the different recommendation approaches. While standard strategies perform a neighbor selection based on user similarities, trust-aware recommendation algorithms rely on other aspects indicative of user trust and reliability. In this article we restate the trust-aware recommendation problem, generalizing it in terms of performance prediction techniques, whose goal is to predict the performance of an information retrieval system in response to a particular query. We investigate how to adopt the preceding generalization to define a unified framework where we conduct an objective analysis of the effectiveness (predictive power) of neighbor scoring functions. The proposed framework enables discriminating whether recommendation performance improvements are caused by the used neighbor scoring functions or by the ways these functions are used in the recommendation computation. We evaluated our approach with several state-of-the-art and novel neighbor scoring functions on three publicly available datasets. By empirically comparing four neighbor quality metrics and thirteen performance predictors, we found strong predictive power for some of the predictors with respect to certain metrics. This result was then validated by checking the final performance of recommendation strategies where predictors are used for selecting and/or weighting user neighbors. As a result, we have found that, by measuring the predictive power of neighbor performance predictors, we are able to anticipate which predictors are going to perform better in neighbor-scoring-powered versions of a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm.', 'pos_extraction': ['Userbased', 'collaborative', 'interesting', 'similarminded', 'different', 'standard', 'user',

In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study.

In this setting, each agent expresses her belief through a propositional formula and revises her own belief at each step by considering the beliefs of her acquaintances, using belief change tools. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which BRGs satisfy some monotonicity properties, i.e., whether promoting some desired piece of belief to a given set of agents is actually always useful for making it accepted by all of them. We formally capture such a concept of promotion by a new family of belief change operators.

We introduce the architecture of an existing video transcoding system which is tightly coupled with an existing video sharing service. We examine the horizontal scalability of the video transcoding system on AWS EC2. With an online transaction processing (OLTP) model, the system achieves linear horizontal scalability up to 1,000 vCPU cores, but starts to experience performance degradation beyond that. We analyze the resource consumption pattern of the existing system, then introduce an improved architecture by adding a message queue layer. This effectively decouples the video transcoding system from the video sharing service and converts the OLTP model into a batch processing model. Large-scale evaluations on AWS EC2 indicate that the improved design maintains linear horizontal scalability at 10,100 vCPU cores. The hybrid design of the system allows it to be easily adapted for other batch processing use cases without the need to modify or recompile the application.', 'pos_extraction': ['largescale',

Two distinct replication modes are supported: simple redundancy (RAIN-0) and stripped redundancy (RAIN-S).

      "{'input_text': ' Given an $N$-relay Gaussian Half-Duplex (HD) diamond network, can we achieve a significant fraction of the capacity of the full network by operating only a subset of $k$ relays? This paper seeks to answer this question, which is also known as the {it network simplification} problem. Building upon the recent result of Cardone et al., this work proves that there always exists a subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays that approximately (i.e., up to a constant gap) achieves a fraction $frac{N-1}{N}$ of the capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown to be tight, i.e., there exists a class of Gaussian HD diamond networks with $N$ relays where the best (i.e., the one with the largest capacity) subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays has an approximate capacity of $frac{N-1}{N}$ of the capacity of the full network. Moreover, it is shown that any optimal schedule of the full network can be used by at least one of the ${N}choose{k}$ subnetworks of $k$ relays to achieve a worst performance guarantee of $frac{k}{N}$. The key step of the proof lies in the derivation of properties of submodular functions, which provide a combinatorial handle of the network simplification problem in Gaussian HD diamond networks.',

In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable because of, for example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is desirable to disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so that each of the n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet and the original k source packets can be recovered later in a computationally simple way from any (1 + \\\\varepsilon)k nodes for some small \\\\varepsilon 0. We developed two distributed algorithms for solving this problem based on simple random walks and Fountain codes. Unlike all previously developed schemes, our solution is truly distributed, that is, nodes do not know n, k or connectivity in the network, except in their own neighborhoods, and they do not maintain any routing tables. In the first algorithm, all the sensors have the knowledge of n and k. In the second algorithm, each sensor estimates these parameters through the random walk dissemination. We present analysis of the communication/transmission and encoding/decoding complexity of these two algorithms, and provide extensive simulation results as well.', 'pos_extraction': ['largescale',

Myerson (1981) shows that the second price auction with an appropriate reserve price is optimal when bidders' values are drawn i.i.d. from a known regular distribution. A cornerstone in the prior-independent revenue maximization literature is a result by Bulow and Klemperer (1996) showing that the second price auction without a reserve achieves (n-1)/n of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We construct a randomized mechanism that strictly outperforms the second price auction in this setting. Our mechanism inflates the second highest bid with a probability that varies with $n$. For two bidders we improve the performance guarantee from 0.5 to 0.512 of the optimal revenue. We also resolve a question in the design of revenue optimal mechanisms that have access to a single sample from an unknown distribution. We show that a randomized mechanism strictly outperforms all deterministic mechanisms in terms of worst case guarantee.\", 'pos_extraction': ['optimal', 'n', 'symmetric', 'fundamental', 'second',

Given an input animation drawn digitally, our approach works by combining motion extraction and inbetweening techniques to generate a reduced-noise sketchy animation registered to the input animation. The amount of noise is then controlled by a continuous parameter value. Our method can be applied to effectively reduce the temporal noise present in sequences of sketches to a desired rate, while preserving the geometric richness of the sketchy style in each frame. This provides the manipulation of temporal noise as an additional artistic parameter, e.g. to emphasize character emotions and scene atmosphere, and enables the display of sketchy content to broader audiences by producing animations with comfortable noise levels.

Consider a transportation network (weighted graph) G where a subset of the edges are upgradable, i.e., for each such edge there is a cost, which if spent, the weight of the edge can be reduced to a specific new value. In the single-pair version of BUP, the input includes a source and a destination in G, and a budget B (resource constraint). The goal is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgraded so that the shortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network) is minimized, without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade. In the multiple-pair version of BUP, a set Q of source-destination pairs is given, and the problem is to choose for upgrade those edges that lead to the smallest sum of shortest path distances across all pairs in Q, subject to budget constraint B. In addition to transportation networks, the BUP query arises in other domains too, such as telecommunications. We propose a framework for BUP processing and evaluate it with experiments on large, real road networks.', 'pos_extraction': ['weighted', 'upgradable', 'such', 'specific', 'new', 'singlepair',

      "{'input_text': ' The authors provide a complete method for describing and recognizing 3-D objects, using surface information. Their system takes as input dense range date and automatically produces a symbolic description of the objects in the scene in terms of their visible surface patches. This segmented representation may be viewed as a graph whose nodes capture information about the individual surface patches and whose links represent the relationships between them, such as occlusion and connectivity. On the basis of these relations, a graph for a given scene is decomposed into subgraphs corresponding to different objects. A model is represented by a set of such descriptions from multiple viewing angles, typically four to six. Models can therefore be acquired and represented automatically. Matching between the objects in a scene and the models is performed by three modules: the screener, in which the most likely candidate views for each object are found; the graph matcher, which compares the potential matching graphs and computes the 3-D transformation between them; and the analyzer, which takes a critical look at the results and proposes to split and merge object graphs.',

      "{'input_text': ' Image classification and annotation are important problems in computer vision, but rarely considered together Intuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely annotated with words \"road,\" \"car\" and \"traffic\" than words \"fish,\" \"boat,\" and \"scuba.\" In this paper we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance.',

      "{'input_text': ' Distributed hard real-time systems require guaranteed communication. One common approach is to restrict network access by enforcing a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule.The typical data representation of offlinegenerated TDMA schedules is table-like structures. This representation, however, does not permit applications with dynamic communication demands, because the table-like structure prevents on-the-fly changes during execution. A common approach for applications with dynamic communication behavior is dynamic TDMA schedules. However, such schedules are hard to verify, because they are usually implemented in a programming language, which does not support verification. Network code is a behavioral model for specifying realtime communication schedules. It allows modeling arbitrary time-triggered communication schedules with on-thefly choices, and it is also apt for formal verification. In this work, we present network code and show how we can use a model checker to verify safety properties such as collision-free communication, schedulability, and guaranteed message reception.

Understanding how users in a network update opinions based on their neighbor's opinions, as well as what global opinion structure is implied when users iteratively update opinions, is important in the context of viral marketing and information dissemination, as well as targeting messages to users in the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling how users update opinions based on their neighbors' opinions. We perform a set of online user studies based on the celebrated conformity experiments of Asch [1]. Our experiments are carefully crafted to derive quantitative insights into developing a model for opinion updates (as opposed to deriving psychological insights). We show that existing and widely studied theoretical models do not explain the entire gamut of experimental observations we make. This leads us to posit a new, nuanced model that we term the BVM. We present preliminary theoretical and simulation results on the convergence and structure of opinions in the entire network when users iteratively update their respective opinions according to the BVM. We show that consensus and polarization of opinions arise naturally in this model under easy to interpret initial conditions on the network.\", 'pos_extraction': ['social', 'social', 'such', 'update',

      "{'input_text': \" This paper addresses the smallest grammar problem: What is the smallest context-free grammar that generates exactly one given string σ? This is a natural question about a fundamental object connected to many fields such as data compression, Kolmogorov complexity, pattern identification, and addition chains. Due to the problem's inherent complexity, our objective is to find an approximation algorithm which finds a small grammar for the input string. We focus attention on the approximation ratio of the algorithm (and implicitly, the worst case behavior) to establish provable performance guarantees and to address shortcomings in the classical measure of redundancy in the literature. Our first results are concern the hardness of approximating the smallest grammar problem. Most notably, we show that every efficient algorithm for the smallest grammar problem has approximation ratio at least 8569/8568 unless P=NP. We then bound approximation ratios for several of the best known grammar-based compression algorithms, including LZ78, B ISECTION, SEQUENTIAL, LONGEST MATCH, GREEDY, and RE-PAIR. Among these, the best upper bound we show is O(n12/). We finish by presenting two novel algorithms with exponentially better ratios of O(log3n) and O(log(n/m*)), where m* is the size of the smallest grammar for that input. The latter algorithm highlights a connection between grammar-based compression and LZ77.\", 'pos_extraction': ['smallest', 'smallest', 'contextfree', 'natural', 'fundamental', 'many', 'such',

      "{'input_text': ' In this paper, we present P-Hera, a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for scalable and secure content hosting. PHera allows the users and content owners to dynamically establish trust using fine-grained access control. In P-Hera, resource owners can specify fine-grained restrictions on who can access their resources and which user can access which part of data. We differentiate our work with traditional works of fine-grained access control on Web services, as our system in addition to handling access constrains of the service provider (which is the case in Web services), it also handles security constrains regarding actions performed on data: replication and modification. We believe this is of immense significance for wide-range of applications such as data Grids, Information Grids and Web Content Delivery Networks. In addition to presenting the overall system architecture, we also study the problem of evaluating these fine-grained access policies in depth and propose a novel means of organizing these policies that can result in faster evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using prototype implementation.', 'pos_extraction': ['present', 'scalable', 'secure', 'finegrained', 'finegrained', 'traditional', 'finegrained',

We have paired an example remote electrocardiography application to this wireless system. We also developed a tool chain that uses a formal description of the proposed wireless medical system architecture in the architecture analysis and design language to assess various combinations of system parameters: we can determine the QoS in terms of packet-delivery ratio and the service latency, and also the size of jitter buffer required for seamless ECG monitoring. A realistic assessment, based on data from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia database, shows that the proposed wireless system can achieve an appropriate level of QoS for real-time ECG monitoring if link-level error control is correctly implemented.

Traditional data selection scheme often selects a batch of data at a time and label them all together, which neglects the data's correlation and thus jeopardizes the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Certainty Propagation (DCP) scheme for informative data selection. For each unlabeled data, we define the notion of certainty to quantify our confidence in its predicted label. Every time, we only label one single data point with the lowest degree of certainty. Then we update the rest unlabeled data's certainty dynamically according to their correlation. This one-by-one labeling offers us extra guidance from the last labeled data for the next labeling. Experiments show that the DCP scheme outperforms the traditional method evidently.\", 'pos_extraction': ['selective', 'informative', 'novel', 'informative', 'unlabeled', 'predicted', 'single',

      "{'input_text': ' We consider the verification of safety (strict serializability and abort consistency) and liveness (obstruction and livelock freedom) for the hybrid transactional memory framework FlexTM. This framework allows for flexible implementations of transactional memories based on an adaptation of the MESI coherence protocol. FlexTM allows for both eager and lazy conflict resolution strategies. Like in the case of Software Transactional Memories, the verification problem is not trivial as the number of concurrent transactions, their size, and the number of accessed shared variables cannot be a priori bounded. This complexity is exacerbated by aspects that are specific to hardware and hybrid transactional memories. Our work takes into account intricate behaviours such as cache line based conflict detection, false sharing, invisible reads or non-transactional instructions. We carry out the first automatic verification of a hybrid transactional memory and establish, by adopting a small model approach, challenging properties such as strict serializability, abort consistency, and obstruction freedom for both an eager and a lazy conflict resolution strategies. We also detect an example that refutes livelock freedom. To achieve this, our prototype tool makes use of the latest antichain based techniques to handle systems with tens of thousands of states.', 'pos_extraction': ['strict', 'hybrid', 'transactional',

      "{'input_text': ' In this work, we propose and assess a technique called bypass processing for optimizing the evaluation of disjunctive queries with expensive predicates. The technique is particularly useful for optimizing selection predicates that contain terms whose evaluation costs vary tremendously; e.g., the evaluation of a nested subquery or the invocation of a user-defined function in an object-oriented or extended relational model may be orders of magnitude more expensive than an attribute access (and comparison). The idea of bypass processing consists of avoiding the evaluation of such expensive terms whenever the outcome of the entire selection predicate can already be induced by testing other, less expensive terms. In order to validate the viability of bypass evaluation, we extend a previously developed optimizer architecture and incorporate three alternative optimization algorithms for generating bypass processing plans.', 'pos_extraction': ['disjunctive', 'expensive', 'useful', 'nested', 'userdefined', 'objectoriented', 'extended', 'relational', 'expensive', 'attribute', 'such', 'expensive',

      "{'input_text': ' In this paper, we design and evaluate SORS- a scalable online ridesharing system, where drivers and passengers send their requests for a ride in advance, possibly on a short notice. SORS is modular and consists of two main, loosely coupled, components: the Constraint Satisfier and the Matching Module. The Constraint Satisfier takes as input information about the desired trajectories and spatio-temporal constraints of drivers and passengers and it returns a list of feasible (driver, passenger) pairs. We use a road networks data structure, optimized for the specific spatio-temporal queries in the context of ridesharing, and we show that our Constraint Satisfier has a 4.65x more scalable query time than a general-purpose database. We represent the feasible pairs of drivers and passengers as a weighted bipartite graph with edge weight being the length of the shared trip of the pair, which captures the revenue in real-world ridesharing systems, such as Lyft Carpool. The Matching Module then takes as input this weighted bipartite graph and returns the maximum weighted matching (MWM), using an algorithm that solves the problem online and efficiently, by incrementally updating the matching solution in real-time. We show that our algorithm achieves 51% larger weight (i.e., total revenue) compared to greedy heuristics used by many real systems today. We also evaluate the SORS system as a whole, using mobile datasets to extract driver trajectories and passenger locations in urban environments. We show that SORS can provide a ridesharing recommendation to individual users within a sub-second query response time, even at high workloads.', 'pos_extraction': ['scalable', 'short', 'modular',

LRU has been studied analytically in the literature under the assumption that the object requests are independent. However, such an assumption does not seem to be in agreement with recent studies of Web-traces, which indicate the existence of short term correlations among the requests. This paper introduces an approximate analysis that fairly accurately predicts the hit ratio of the LRU policy in the case of short term correlations. The approximation approach is based on the relation between the working set model and LRU, while the request generation process is assumed to follow a recently proposed model for Web-traces, which captures short term correlations among the requests. The accuracy of the introduced approximate analysis is validated for synthetic as well as real Web-traces.', 'pos_extraction': ['least', 'many', 'other', 'independent', 'such', 'recent', 'short',

As a consequence, random testing would be rather unpredictable. We evaluate the variance of the number of faults detected by random testing over time. We present the results of an empirical study that is based on 1215 hours of randomly testing 27 Eiffel classes, each with 30 seeds of the random number generator. Analyzing over 6 million failures triggered during the experiments, the study provides evidence that the relative number of faults detected by random testing over time is predictable but that different runs of the random test case generator detect different faults. The study also shows that random testing quickly finds faults: the first failure is likely to be triggered within 30 seconds.', 'pos_extraction': ['random', 'objectoriented', 'significant',

Since energy consumption is a key issue for wireless devices, wireless network researchers often need to investigate the energy consumption at a battery powered node or in the overall network, while running network simulations. This requires the underlying simulator to support energy consumption and energy source modeling. Currently however, ns-3 does not provide any support for modeling energy consumption or energy sources. In this paper, we introduce an integrated energy framework for ns-3, with models for energy source as well as energy consumption.

      "{'input_text': ' Performing random walks in networks is a fundamental primitive that has found numerous applications in communication networks such as token management, load balancing, network topology discovery and construction, search, and peer-to-peer membership management. While several such algorithms are ubiquitous, and use numerous random walk samples, the walks themselves have always been performed naively.In this paper, we focus on the problem of performing random walk sampling efficiently in a distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds and messages required to obtain several random walk samples in a continuous online fashion. We present the first round and message optimal distributed algorithms that present a significant improvement on all previous approaches. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations of our algorithms show that they perform very well in different types of networks of differing topologies.In particular, our results show how several random walks can be performed continuously (when source nodes are provided only at runtime, i.e., online), such that each walk of length ¿ can be performed exactly in just O ¿ ( ¿ D ) rounds11Throughout this paper, O ¿ hides polylogarithmic factors in the number of nodes in the network. (where D is the diameter of the network), and O ( ¿ ) messages. This significantly improves upon both, the naive technique that requires O ( ¿ ) rounds and O ( ¿ ) messages, and the sophisticated algorithm of Das Sarma et¿al. (2013) that has the same round complexity as this paper but requires ¿ ( m ¿ ) messages (where m is the number of edges in the network). Our theoretical results are corroborated through extensive simulations on various topological data sets. Our algorithms are fully decentralized, lightweight, and easily implementable, and can serve as building blocks in the design of topologically-aware networks. We consider the problem of sampling nodes through random walks in a distributed network.We present algorithm to compute several random walk samples in a continuous online fashion.Our algorithm

However, most of the available systems require special devices and environment, or even attach extra things onto an actor. To realize a personal system, we developed general type software to acquire arbitrary motion from a video sequence. A 3D articulate human model with changeable size, color and surface shape is constructed and personalized to fit with a focused figure in the video.Either the personal model is then driven automatically or manually to match with the moving body in the consecutive image frames. This matching starts from key frames that contain key poses. A smooth motion is then interpolated in between key frames. In addition, the evaluation of the generated motion is enhanced by image correlation. We provide various methods to make the matching feasible in order to reduce the modeling time. This approach is suitable for personal use to meet wide needs of human motion acquisition.', 'pos_extraction': ['real', 'various', 'visual', 'nonvisual', 'most', 'available', 'special', 'extra',

      "{'input_text': ' The emergence of location-aware services calls for new real time spatio-temporal query processing algorithms that deal with large numbers of mobile objects and queries. Online query response is an important characterization of location-aware services. A delay in the answer to a query gives invalid and obsolete results, simply because moving objects can change their locations before the query responds. To handle large numbers of spatio-temporal queries efficiently, we propose the idea of sharing as a means to achieve scalability. In this paper, we introduce several types of sharing in the context of continuous spatio-temporal queries. Examples of sharing in the context of real-time spatio-temporal database systems include sharing the execution, sharing the underlying space, sharing the sliding time windows, and sharing the objects of interest. We demonstrate how sharing can be integrated into query predicates, e.g., selection and spatial join processing. The goal of this paper is to outline research directions and approaches that will lead to scalable and efficient location-aware services.', 'pos_extraction': ['locationaware', 'new', 'real',

One important trend is the increased presence of resource hungry applications like gaming and multimedia applications. One of the key distinguishing factors of these applications is that they are amenable to variable semantics (ie, multiple possibilities of results) unlike traditional applications wherein a fixed, unique answer is expected. For example, varying degrees of image processing improves picture quality, different model complexities used in game physics allow different degrees of realism during game play, and so on. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that scalable semantics in applications such as video games can be enriched with optional tasks that can be launched and thus adapt to the amount of available resources at runtime. We propose a C/C++ API that allows the programmer to define how the current semantics of a program can be opportunistically enriched, as well as the underlying runtime system that orchestrates the different computations We show how this infrastructure can be used to enrich a well known game called Quake 3. Our results show that it is possible to perform significant enrichment without degrading the application's performance by utilizing additional cores.\", 'pos_extraction': ['other', 'personal',

      "{'input_text': ' The lack of good \"correlation\" between pre-silicon simulated delays and measured delays on silicon (silicon data) has spurred efforts on so-called silicon debug. The identification of speed-limiting paths, or simply speedpaths, in silicon debug is a crucial step, required for both \"fixing\" failing paths and for accurate learning from silicon data. We propose using characterized, pre-silicon, variational timing models to identify speedpaths that can best explain the observed delays from silicon measurements. Delays of all logic paths are written as affine functions of process parameters, called hyperplanes, and a branch and bound approach is then applied to find the \"best\" path combinations. Our method has been tested on a set of ISCAS-89 circuits and the results show that it accurately identifies the speedpaths in most cases, and that this is achieved in a very efficient manner.',

      "{'input_text': ' The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle deformation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand animation. We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressiveness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those created manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture system to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art-directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.', 'pos_extraction': ['facial', 'rich', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'finescale',

      "{'input_text': \" Accurate simulation of light transport in participating media is expensive, due to the many scattering events. However, the band-limiting effect of scattering in media makes this kind of light transport very suitable for adaptive sampling and reconstruction techniques. In this work we present a novel algorithm that adaptively samples radiance from sparse points in the medium using up-to second-order occlusion-aware derivatives to determine when interpolation is appropriate. We derive our metric from each point's incoming light field. We use a proxy triangulation-based representation of the radiance reflected by the surrounding medium and geometry to efficiently compute the first- and second-order derivatives of the radiance at the cache points while accounting for occlusion changes. We validate the quality of our approach on a self-contained two-dimensional model for light transport in media. Then we show how our results generalize to practical three-dimensional scenarios, where we show much better results while reducing computation time up to a 30% compared to previous work.\",

Based on our previous work, we add two additional motion abilities: leaping and moving obstacles into the system. In previous work, the order of moving obstacles is determined first, and then the corresponding paths for the pushing/pulling motions are generated. In this work, we take a unified approach that accounts for all types of motions at the same time.

      "{'input_text': ' Sentence structure is considered to be an important component of the overall linguistic quality of text. Yet few empirical studies have sought to characterize how and to what extent structural features determine fluency and linguistic quality. We report the results of experiments on the predictive power of syntactic phrasing statistics and other structural features for these aspects of text. Manual assessments of sentence fluency for machine translation evaluation and text quality for summarization evaluation are used as gold-standard. We find that many structural features related to phrase length are weakly but significantly correlated with fluency and classifiers based on the entire suite of structural features can achieve high accuracy in pairwise comparison of sentence fluency and in distinguishing machine translations from human translations. We also test the hypothesis that the learned models capture general fluency properties applicable to human-authored text. The results from our experiments do not support the hypothesis. At the same time structural features and models based on them prove to be robust for automatic evaluation of the linguistic quality of multidocument summaries.', 'pos_extraction': ['important',

Although there has been a significant amount of research in recent years on the design of such strategies, there has been very little investigation of their cost-effectiveness. This paper presents some computationally efficient predictors of the cost-effectiveness of the two main classes of selective regression testing approaches. These predictors are computed from data about the coverage relationship between the system under test and its test suite. The paper then describes case studies in which these predictors were used to predict the cost-effectiveness of applying two different regression testing strategies to two software systems. In one case study, the TESTTUBE method selected an average of 88.1 percent of the available test cases in each version, while the predictor predicted that 87.3 percent of the test cases would be

The performance of this task is important for the Reyes pipeline to map efficiently to graphics hardware, but its recursive nature and irregular and unbounded memory requirements present a challenge to an efficient implementation. Our solution begins by characterizing Reyes subdivision as a work queue with irregular computation, targeted to a massively parallel GPU. We propose efficient solutions to these general problems by casting our solution in terms of the fundamental primitives of prefix-sum and reduction, often encountered in parallel and GPGPU environments. Our results indicate that real-time Reyes subdivision can indeed be obtained on today's GPUs. We are able to subdivide a complex model to subpixel accuracy within 15 ms. Our measured performance is several times better than that of Pixar's RenderMan. Our implementation scales well with the input size and depth of subdivision. We also address concerns of memory size and bandwidth, and analyze the feasibility of conventional ideas on screen-space buckets.\", 'pos_extraction': ['adaptive', 'important', 'recursive',

Without adequate privacy protection, however, these systems can be easily misused, for example, to track users or target them for home invasion. In this paper, we introduce LocX, a novel alternative that provides significantly improved location privacy without adding uncertainty into query results or relying on strong assumptions about server security. Our key insight is to apply secure user-specific, distance-preserving coordinate transformations to all location data shared with the server. The friends of a user share this user's secrets so they can apply the same transformation. This allows all location queries to be evaluated correctly by the server, but our privacy mechanisms guarantee that servers are unable to see or infer the actual location data from the transformed data or from the data access. We show that LocX provides privacy even against a powerful adversary model, and we use prototype measurements to show that it provides privacy with very little performance overhead, making it suitable for today's mobile devices.\", 'pos_extraction': ['geosocial', 'such', 'adequate', 'novel', 'alternative', 'query', 'strong', 'server', 'key', 'secure', 'userspecific', 'distancepreserving', 'same',

      "{'input_text': \" We propose a novel tracking algorithm based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo sampling method which efficiently deals with the abrupt motions. Abrupt motions could cause conventional tracking methods to fail since they violate the motion smoothness constraint. To address this problem, we introduce the Wang-Landau algorithm that has been recently proposed in statistical physics, and integrate this algorithm into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo based tracking method. Our tracking method alleviates the motion smoothness constraint utilizing both the likelihood term and the density of states term, which is estimated by the Wang-Landau algorithm. The likelihood term helps to improve the accuracy in tracking smooth motions, while the density of states term captures abrupt motions robustly. Experimental results reveal that our approach efficiently samples the object's states even in a whole state space without loss of time. Therefore, it tracks the object of which motion is drastically changing, accurately and robustly.\", 'pos_extraction': ['novel', 'abrupt', 'conventional', 'statistical', 'likelihood', 'likelihood',

To ensure fast detection, the HRTFs are reduced using three different techniques, namely; Diffuse-Field Equalization, Balanced Model Truncation, and Principle Component Analysis.

This criterion is then used to find the sound source location in accordance with the reduced HRTF datasets. The suggested method is verified through simulated examples and further tested in a household environment.

      "{'input_text': ' SOAP has been widely adopted as a simple, robust and extensible XML-based protocol for the exchange of messages among web services. Unfortunately, SOAP communications have two major performance-related drawbacks: i) verbosity, related to XML, that leads to increased network traffic, and ii) high computational burden of XML parsing and processing, that leads to high latency. In this paper, we address these two issues and introduce a novel framework for Differential SOAP Multicasting (DSM). The main idea consists in identifying the common pattern and differences between SOAP messages, modeled as trees, so as to multicast similar messages together. Our method is based on the well known concept of Tree Edit Distance, built upon a novel filter-differencing architecture to reduce message aggregation time, identifying only those messages which are relevant (i.e., similar enough) for similarity evaluation. In addition, our technique exploits a dedicated differencing output format specifically designed to carry the minimum amount of diff information, in the multicast message, so as to minimize the multicast message size, and therefore reducing the network traffic. The battery of simulation experiments conducted to evaluate our approach shows the relevance of our method in comparison with traditional and dedicated multicasting techniques.', 'pos_extraction':

      "{'input_text': ' Most interactive segmentation methods are defined at a 2-D level requiring sometimes extensive interaction when the object of interest is difficult to be outlined by simple means of segmentation. This may become tedious if the data happens to be a 3-D scene of which a part of the differentiating features of a structure is buried in 3-D contextual information. We propose a concept of extending interactive or semi-automatic segmentation to 3-D where coherence information may be exploited more efficiently. A non-analysed scene may be evaluated using volume rendering techniques with which the user interacts to extract the structures that he or she is interested in. The approach is based on a concept of a co-operative system that communicates with the user for finding the best rendition and analysis. Within the concept we present a new method of estimating rendering parameters if the object of interest is only partially analysed.', 'pos_extraction': ['Most', 'interactive', '2D', 'extensive',

      "{'input_text': \" CONTEXT: Systematic literature reviews largely rely upon using the titles and abstracts of primary studies as the basis for determining their relevance. However, our experience indicates that the abstracts for software engineering papers are frequently of such poor quality they cannot be used to determine the relevance of papers. Both medicine and psychology recommend the use of structured abstracts to improve the quality of abstracts. AIM: This study investigates whether structured abstracts are more complete and easier to understand than non-structured abstracts for software engineering papers that describe experiments. METHOD: We constructed structured abstracts for a random selection of 25 papers describing software engineering experiments. The original abstract was assessed for clarity (assessed subjectively on a scale of 1 to 10) and completeness (measured with a questionnaire of 18 items) by the researcher who constructed the structured version. The structured abstract was reviewed for clarity and completeness by another member of the research team. We used a paired 't' test to compare the word length, clarity and completeness of the original and structured abstracts. RESULTS: The structured abstracts were significantly longer than the original abstracts (size difference =106.4 words with 95% confidence interval 78.1 to 134.7). However, the structured abstracts had a higher clarity score (clarity difference= 1.47 with 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 2.41) and were more complete (completeness difference=3.39 with 95% confidence intervals 4.76 to 7.56). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with previous research on structured abstracts. However, in this study, the subjective estimates of completeness and clarity were made by the research team. Future work will solicit assessments of the structured and original abstracts from independent sources (students and researchers).\", 'pos_extraction': ['Systematic', 'rely', 'primary', 'such',

      "{'input_text': ' Boltzmann machines are undirected graphical models with two-state stochastic variables, in which the logarithms of the clique potentials are quadratic functions of the node states. They have been widely studied in the neural computing literature, although their practical applicability has been limited by the difficulty of finding an effective learning algorithm. One well-established approach, known as mean field theory, represents the stochastic distribution using a factorized approximation. However, the corresponding learning algorithm often fails to find a good solution. We conjecture that this is due to the implicit uni-modality of the mean field approximation which is therefore unable to capture multi-modality in the true distribution. In this paper we use variational methods to approximate the stochastic distribution using multi-modal mixtures of factorized distributions. We present results for both inference and learning to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.', 'pos_extraction': ['undirected', 'graphical', 'twostate', 'stochastic', 'quadratic', 'node',

      "{'input_text': \" During the last decade, the number of functions of automotive user interfaces has increased rapidly. Besides traditional controls to drive a car, driver assistance, infotainment, entertainment, and comfort systems need to be controlled while driving. This does not only affect the driver's cognitive workload but also leads to increased complexity in designing automotive user interfaces. In this paper, we provide models and tools for rapid prototyping and the evaluation of user interfaces in this context. Usually, functional prototypes of user interfaces are implemented that allow the usability and quality to be assessed with time-consuming user studies. In contrast, in our approach we use an adapted Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) that is based on empirically collected data for typical operations in the car. It takes into account the aspect of attention switching in the car between primary tasks and other tasks. We present KLM operator times that we determined in a user study as well as a formula for estimating the task completion time. The presented model is the foundation for the MI-AUI prototyping tool that we implemented for permitting the creation of automotive interfaces using tangible controls. By demonstrating a typical operation with the MI-AUI prototype, the estimated task completion time can be calculated. MI-AUI is an evaluation tool that can be quickly and easily applied in early stages of the design process without the need to involve real drivers.\", 'pos_extraction': ['last', 'automotive',

      "{'input_text': ' Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities. The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts.', 'pos_extraction': ['handy', 'cognitive', 'emotional', 'social', 'several', 'many',

SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage for sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload compute-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation. We have implemented a SOAR prototype and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. The results show that SOAR can accurately detect debris in the presence of various environment and system dynamics, and the rotation scheduling algorithm enables SOAR to capture debris arrivals with

      "{'input_text': \" Large-scale donation-based distributed infrastructures need to cope with the inherent unreliability of participant nodes. A widely-used work scheduling technique in such en- vironments is to redundantly schedule the outsourced com- putations to a number of nodes. We present the design and implementation of RIDGE, a reliability-aware system which uses a node's prior performance and behavior to make more effective scheduling decisions. We have imple- mented RIDGE on top of the BOINC distributed comput- ing infrastructure and have evaluated its performance on a live PlanetLab testbed. Our experimental results show that RIDGE is able to match or surpass the throughput of the best BOINC configuration by automatically adapting to the characteristics of the underlying environment. In additio n, RIDGE is able to provide much lower workunit makespans compared to BOINC. RIDGE is also able to produce signif- icantly lower communication makespans for downloading clients. Collectively, the results suggest that RIDGE has great promise for service-oriented environments with time constraints. putation and communication performance of the nodes. These problems arise as nodes have dynamically changing workloads, may leave and join unexpectedly, and may be- have maliciously. When nodes are serving data, their ex- treme time-varying heterogeneity in terms of different ca- pacity, bandwidth, and latency can also compromise perfor- mance. For the first problem, we present a scheme that can dynamically adjust the degree of replication based on the current node behavior. In an earlier paper, we showed how intelligent replication can improve performance through a simulation study (9). This paper focuses on the implemen- tation and deployment of the proposed ideas in a live envi- ronment. For the second problem, we present a scheme that can dynamically select the most appropriate nodes for data download based on current network dynamics. The key contribution is that clients can make independent download decisions from replicated data nodes without direct intera c- tion and minimal state. We have deployed a prototype of RIDGE and evaluated it on a live distributed testbed on PlanetLab (3), using the BLAST (4) bioinformatics application. The results show that RIDGE can automatically match, and in some cases surpass, the best static BOINC performance (which requires knowing the dynamics of the environment) in terms of re- liability, and can achieve far better computation makespan. The results also show that communication makespan can be significantly reduced using our schemes (17-43% improve- ment over existing heuristics). Collectively, these resul ts indicate that RIDGE is well-suited to service-oriented envi- ronments with time constraints.\", 'pos_extraction': ['Largescale', 'donationbased', 'inherent',

In particular, humanoid robots should learn new skills incrementally through autonomous exploration, and adapt to different contexts. In this paper we consider the problem of learning forward models for task space control under dynamically varying kinematic contexts: the robot learns incrementally and autonomously its forward kinematics under different contexts, represented by the inclusion of different tools, and exploits the learned model to realize reaching with those tools. We model the forward kinematics as a multi-valued function, in which different outputs for the same input query are related to different tools (i.e. contexts). The model is estimated using IMLE, a recent online learning algorithm for multi-valued regression, and used for control. No information is given about the tool changes, nor any assumption is made about the tool kinematics. Results are provided both in simulation and with a full-body humanoid.

      "{'input_text': ' Computing the Euler genus of a graph is a fundamental problem in graph theory and topology. It has been shown to be NP-hard by Thomassen [27] and a linear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by Mohar [20]. Despite extensive study, the approximability of the Euler genus remains wide open. While the existence of a constant factor approximation is not ruled out, the currently best-known upper bound is a trivial O(n/g)-approximation that follows from bounds on the Euler characteristic. In this paper, we give the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this problem. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm which given a graph G of Euler genus g outputs an embedding of G into a surface of Euler genus gO(1). Combined with the above O(n/g)-approximation, our result also implies a O(n1-α)-approximation, for some universal constant α> 0. Our approximation algorithm also has implications for the design of algorithms on graphs of small genus. Several of these algorithms require that an embedding of the graph into a surface of small genus is given as part of the input. Our result implies that many of these algorithms can be implemented even when the embedding of the input graph is unknown.', 'pos_extraction': ['fundamental', 'NPhard', 'lineartime', 'extensive',

We show that for a pair of corresponding conics, the parameters representing the conics satisfy a linear constraint. To be more specific, the parameters that represent a conic in one image are transformed by a five-dimensional projective transformation to the parameters that represent the corresponding conic in another image. We also show that this transformation is expressed as the symmetric component of the tensor product of the transformation based on point/line correspondences and itself. In addition, we present a linear algorithm for uniquely determining the corresponding point-based transformation from a given conic-based transformation up to a scale factor. Accordingly, conic correspondences enable us to easily handle both points and lines in uncalibrated images of a planar object.', 'pos_extraction': ['conic', 'perspective', 'uncalibrated', 'linear',

      "{'input_text': ' Ethnographic studies of the home revealed the fundamental roles that physical locations and context play in how household members understand and manage conventional information. Yet we also know that digital information is becoming increasingly important to households. The problem is that this digital information is almost always tied to traditional computer displays, which inhibits its incorporation into household routines. Our solution, location-dependent information appliances, exploit both home location and context (as articulated in ethnographic studies) to enhance the role of ambient displays in the home setting; these displays provide home occupants with both background awareness of an information source and foreground methods to gain further details if desired. The novel aspect is that home occupants assign particular information to locations within a home in a way that makes sense to them. As a device is moved to a particular home location, information is automatically mapped to that device along with hints on how it should be displayed.', 'pos_extraction': ['Ethnographic',

      "{'input_text': ' Model-checkers have recently been suggested for automated software test-case generation. Several works have presented methods that create efficient test-suites using model-checkers. Ease of use and complete automation are major advantages of such approaches. However, the use of a model-checker comes at the price of potential performance problems. If the model used for test-case generation is complex, then model-checker based approaches can be very slow, or even not applicable at all. In this paper, we identify that unnecessary, redundant calls to the model-checker are one of the causes of bad performance. To overcome this problem, we suggest the use of temporal logic rewriting techniques, which originate from runtime verification research. This achieves a significant increase in the performance, and improves the applicability of model-checker based test-case generation approaches in general.

      "{'input_text': ' Several recently-proposed architectures for high-performance object recognition are composed of two main stages: a feature extraction stage that extracts locally-invariant feature vectors from regularly spaced image patches, and a somewhat generic supervised classifier. The first stage is often composed of three main modules: (1) a bank of filters (often oriented edge detectors); (2) a non-linear transform, such as a point-wise squashing functions, quantization, or normalization; (3) a spatial pooling operation which combines the outputs of similar filters over neighboring regions. We propose a method that automatically learns such feature extractors in an unsupervised fashion by simultaneously learning the filters and the pooling units that combine multiple filter outputs together. The method automatically generates topographic maps of similar filters that extract features of orientations, scales, and positions. These similar filters are pooled together, producing locally-invariant outputs. The learned feature descriptors give comparable results as SIFT on image recognition tasks for which SIFT is well suited, and better results than SIFT on tasks for which SIFT is less well suited.',

Whereas service plays an important role in digital ecosystems, there is no technology available to retrieve heterogeneous and geographically dispersed services. Additionally, no methodology has been proposed in the literature that can distinguish or rank the services based on the Quality of Services (QoS). In order to address these issues, we propose a semantic service retrieval engine which incorporates a novel semantic QoS evaluation methodology. The salient feature of this methodology that sets it apart from any other QoS evaluation methodologies is that the evaluation of the service and the subsequent quantification of QoS is a combination of subjective and objective QoS measures. Another salient feature of our proposed methodology is that it enables the domain-specific ranking of services. Finally, an online prototype is implemented to evaluate our methodology, the results of which are discussed in this paper.', 'pos_extraction': ['innovative', 'dynamic', 'open', 'collaborative',

      "{'input_text': ' The fast global k-means (FGKM) clustering algorithm is one of the most effective approaches for resolving the local convergence of the k-means clustering algorithm. Numerical experiments show that it can effectively determine a global or near global minimizer of the cost function. However, the FGKM algorithm needs a large amount of computational time or storage space when handling large data sets. To overcome this deficiency, a more efficient FGKM algorithm, namely FGKM+A, is developed in this paper. In the development, we first apply local geometrical information to describe approximately the set of objects represented by a candidate cluster center. On the basis of the approximate description, we then propose an acceleration mechanism for the production of new cluster centers. As a result of the acceleration, the FGKM+A algorithm not only yields the same clustering results as that of the FGKM algorithm but also requires less computational time and fewer distance calculations than the FGKM algorithm and its existing modifications. The efficiency of the FGKM+A algorithm is further confirmed by experimental studies on several UCI data sets.', 'pos_extraction': ['fast', 'global', 'effective', 'local', 'Numerical', 'global',

      "{'input_text': ' Despite an increase in the number of knowledge bases published according to Semantic Web W3C standards, many of those consist primarily of instance data and lack sophisticated schemata, although the availability of such schemata would allow more powerful querying, consistency checking and debugging as well as improved inference. One of the reasons why schemata are still rare is the effort required to create them. Consequently, numerous ontology learning approaches have been developed to simplify the creation of schemata. Those approaches usually either learn structures from text or existing RDF data. In this submission, we present the first approach combining both sources of evidence, in particular we combine an existing logical learning approach with statistical relevance measures applied on textual resources. We perform an experiment involving a manual evaluation on 100 classes of the DBpedia 3.9 dataset and show that the inclusion of relevance measures leads to a significant improvement of the accuracy

       " 1: {'input_text': ' In our earlier work, we found that feature space induced by tactile receptive fields (TRFs) are better than that by visual receptive fields (VRFs) in texture boundary detection tasks. This suggests that TRFs could be intimately associated with texture-like input. In this paper, we investigate how TRFs can develop in a cortical learning context. Our main hypothesis is that TRFs can be self-organized using the same cortical development mechanism found in the visual cortex, simply by exposing it to texture-like inputs (as opposed to natural-scene-like inputs). To test our hypothesis, we used the LISSOM model of visual cortical development. Our main results show that texture-like inputs lead to the self-organization of TRFs while natural-scene-like inputs lead to VRFs. These results suggest that TRFs can better represent texture than VRFs. We further analyzed the effectiveness of TRFs in representing texture, using kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) and the results, along with texture classification performance, confirm that this is indeed the case. We expect these results to help us better understand the nature of texture, as a fundamentally tactile property.',\n",

In particular, Myerson considered a coalitional game in which cooperation is possible only through an underlying network of links between agents. A unique fair solution concept for graph-restricted games is called the Myerson value. One study generalized these results by considering probabilistic graphs in which agents can cooperate via links only to some extent, that is, with some probability. The authors' algorithm is based on the enumeration of all connected subgraphs in the graph. As a sample application of the new algorithm, they consider a probabilistic graph that represents likelihood of pairwise collaboration between political parties before the 2015 general elections in the UK.\",\n",

       " 4: {'input_text': ' User-based collaborative filtering systems suggest interesting items to a user relying on similar-minded people called neighbors. The selection and weighting of these neighbors characterize the different recommendation approaches. While standard strategies perform a neighbor selection based on user similarities, trust-aware recommendation algorithms rely on other aspects indicative of user trust and reliability. In this article we restate the trust-aware recommendation problem, generalizing it in terms of performance prediction techniques, whose goal is to predict the performance of an information retrieval system in response to a particular query. We investigate how to adopt the preceding generalization to define a unified framework where we conduct an objective analysis of the effectiveness (predictive power) of neighbor scoring functions. The proposed framework enables discriminating whether recommendation performance improvements are caused by the used neighbor scoring functions or by the ways these functions are used in the recommendation computation. We evaluated our approach with several state-of-the-art and novel neighbor scoring functions on three publicly available datasets. By empirically comparing four neighbor quality metrics and thirteen performance predictors, we found strong predictive power for some of the predictors with respect to certain metrics. This result was then validated by checking the final performance of recommendation strategies where predictors are used for selecting and/or weighting user neighbors. As a result, we have found that, by measuring the predictive power of neighbor performance predictors, we are able to anticipate which predictors are going to perform better in neighbor-scoring-powered versions of a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm.',\n",

       " 6: {'input_text': ' Machine learning is an increasingly used computational tool within human-computer interaction research. While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to refining classifier models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques may be a viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly combine multiple classifiers operating on multiple feature sets to produce an ensemble classifier with accuracy that approaches best-reported performance classifying images in the CalTech-101 dataset.',\n",

       " 7: {'input_text': ' We consider the problem of belief propagation in a network of communicating agents, modeled in the recently introduced Belief Revision Game (BRG) framework. In this setting, each agent expresses her belief through a propositional formula and revises her own belief at each step by considering the beliefs of her acquaintances, using belief change tools. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which BRGs satisfy some monotonicity properties, i.e., whether promoting some desired piece of belief to a given set of agents is actually always useful for making it accepted by all of them. We formally capture such a concept of promotion by a new family of belief change operators. We show that some basic monotonicity properties are not satisfied by BRGs in general, even when the agents merging-based revision policies are fully rational (in the AGM sense). We also identify some classes where they hold.',\n",

       " 9: {'input_text': ' In this paper, we present the challenges involved in large-scale video transcoding application in public clouds. We introduce the architecture of an existing video transcoding system which is tightly coupled with an existing video sharing service. We examine the horizontal scalability of the video transcoding system on AWS EC2. With an online transaction processing (OLTP) model, the system achieves linear horizontal scalability up to 1,000 vCPU cores, but starts to experience performance degradation beyond that. We analyze the resource consumption pattern of the existing system, then introduce an improved architecture by adding a message queue layer. This effectively decouples the video transcoding system from the video sharing service and converts the OLTP model into a batch processing model. Large-scale evaluations on AWS EC2 indicate that the improved design maintains linear horizontal scalability at 10,100 vCPU cores. The hybrid design of the system allows it to be easily adapted for other batch processing use cases without the need to modify or recompile the application.',\n",

       " 13: {'input_text': ' Given an $N$-relay Gaussian Half-Duplex (HD) diamond network, can we achieve a significant fraction of the capacity of the full network by operating only a subset of $k$ relays? This paper seeks to answer this question, which is also known as the {it network simplification} problem. Building upon the recent result of Cardone et al., this work proves that there always exists a subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays that approximately (i.e., up to a constant gap) achieves a fraction $frac{N-1}{N}$ of the capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown to be tight, i.e., there exists a class of Gaussian HD diamond networks with $N$ relays where the best (i.e., the one with the largest capacity) subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays has an approximate capacity of $frac{N-1}{N}$ of the capacity of the full network. Moreover, it is shown that any optimal schedule of the full network can be used by at least one of the ${N}choose{k}$ subnetworks of $k$ relays to achieve a worst performance guarantee of $frac{k}{N}$. The key step of the proof lies in the derivation of properties of submodular functions, which provide a combinatorial handle of the network simplification problem in Gaussian HD diamond networks.',\n",

In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable because of, for example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is desirable to disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so that each of the n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet and the original k source packets can be recovered later in a computationally simple way from any (1 + \\\\varepsilon)k nodes for some small \\\\varepsilon 0. We developed two distributed algorithms for solving this problem based on simple random walks and Fountain codes. Unlike all previously developed schemes, our solution is truly distributed, that is, nodes do not know n, k or connectivity in the network, except in their own neighborhoods, and they do not maintain any routing tables. In the first algorithm, all the sensors have the knowledge of n and k. In the second algorithm, each sensor estimates these parameters through the random walk dissemination. We present analysis of the communication/transmission and encoding/decoding complexity of these two algorithms, and provide extensive simulation results as well.',\n",

       " 16: {'input_text': \" Designing revenue optimal auctions for selling an item to $n$ symmetric bidders is a fundamental problem in mechanism design. Myerson (1981) shows that the second price auction with an appropriate reserve price is optimal when bidders' values are drawn i.i.d. from a known regular distribution. A cornerstone in the prior-independent revenue maximization literature is a result by Bulow and Klemperer (1996) showing that the second price auction without a reserve achieves (n-1)/n of the optimal revenue in the worst case. We construct a randomized mechanism that strictly outperforms the second price auction in this setting. Our mechanism inflates the second highest bid with a probability that varies with $n$. For two bidders we improve the performance guarantee from 0.5 to 0.512 of the optimal revenue. We also resolve a question in the design of revenue optimal mechanisms that have access to a single sample from an unknown distribution. We show that a randomized mechanism strictly outperforms all deterministic mechanisms in terms of worst case guarantee.\",\n",

Given an input animation drawn digitally, our approach works by combining motion extraction and inbetweening techniques to generate a reduced-noise sketchy animation registered to the input animation. The amount of noise is then controlled by a continuous parameter value. Our method can be applied to effectively reduce the temporal noise present in sequences of sketches to a desired rate, while preserving the geometric richness of the sketchy style in each frame. This provides the manipulation of temporal noise as an additional artistic parameter, e.g. to emphasize character emotions and scene atmosphere, and enables the display of sketchy content to broader audiences by producing animations with comfortable noise levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a series of rough hand-drawn animations.',\n",

Consider a transportation network (weighted graph) G where a subset of the edges are upgradable, i.e., for each such edge there is a cost, which if spent, the weight of the edge can be reduced to a specific new value. In the single-pair version of BUP, the input includes a source and a destination in G, and a budget B (resource constraint). The goal is to identify which upgradable edges should be upgraded so that the shortest path distance between source and destination (in the updated network) is minimized, without exceeding the available budget for the upgrade. In the multiple-pair version of BUP, a set Q of source-destination pairs is given, and the problem is to choose for upgrade those edges that lead to the smallest sum of shortest path distances across all pairs in Q, subject to budget constraint B. In addition to transportation networks, the BUP query arises in other domains too, such as telecommunications. We propose a framework for BUP processing and evaluate it with experiments on large, real road networks.',\n",

       " 21: {'input_text': ' The authors provide a complete method for describing and recognizing 3-D objects, using surface information. Their system takes as input dense range date and automatically produces a symbolic description of the objects in the scene in terms of their visible surface patches. This segmented representation may be viewed as a graph whose nodes capture information about the individual surface patches and whose links represent the relationships between them, such as occlusion and connectivity. On the basis of these relations, a graph for a given scene is decomposed into subgraphs corresponding to different objects. A model is represented by a set of such descriptions from multiple viewing angles, typically four to six. Models can therefore be acquired and represented automatically. Matching between the objects in a scene and the models is performed by three modules: the screener, in which the most likely candidate views for each object are found; the graph matcher, which compares the potential matching graphs and computes the 3-D transformation between them; and the analyzer, which takes a critical look at the results and proposes to split and merge object graphs.',\n",

       " 22: {'input_text': ' Image classification and annotation are important problems in computer vision, but rarely considered together Intuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely annotated with words \"road,\" \"car\" and \"traffic\" than words \"fish,\" \"boat,\" and \"scuba.\" In this paper we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance.',\n",

       " 23: {'input_text': ' Distributed hard real-time systems require guaranteed communication. One common approach is to restrict network access by enforcing a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule.The typical data representation of offlinegenerated TDMA schedules is table-like structures. This representation, however, does not permit applications with dynamic communication demands, because the table-like structure prevents on-the-fly changes during execution. A common approach for applications with dynamic communication behavior is dynamic TDMA schedules. However, such schedules are hard to verify, because they are usually implemented in a programming language, which does not support verification. Network code is a behavioral model for specifying realtime communication schedules. It allows modeling arbitrary time-triggered communication schedules with on-thefly choices, and it is also apt for formal verification. In this work, we present network code and show how we can use a model checker to verify safety properties such as collision-free communication, schedulability, and guaranteed message reception. We also discuss its implementation in RTLinux and provide performance measurements.',\n",

These opinions could be about topics such as consumer products, politics, life style, or celebrities. Understanding how users in a network update opinions based on their neighbor's opinions, as well as what global opinion structure is implied when users iteratively update opinions, is important in the context of viral marketing and information dissemination, as well as targeting messages to users in the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling how users update opinions based on their neighbors' opinions. We perform a set of online user studies based on the celebrated conformity experiments of Asch [1]. Our experiments are carefully crafted to derive quantitative insights into developing a model for opinion updates (as opposed to deriving psychological insights). We show that existing and widely studied theoretical models do not explain the entire gamut of experimental observations we make. This leads us to posit a new, nuanced model that we term the BVM. We present preliminary theoretical and simulation results on the convergence and structure of opinions in the entire network when users iteratively update their respective opinions according to the BVM. We show that consensus and polarization of opinions arise naturally in this model under easy to interpret initial conditions on the network.\",\n",

       " 25: {'input_text': \" This paper addresses the smallest grammar problem: What is the smallest context-free grammar that generates exactly one given string σ? This is a natural question about a fundamental object connected to many fields such as data compression, Kolmogorov complexity, pattern identification, and addition chains. Due to the problem's inherent complexity, our objective is to find an approximation algorithm which finds a small grammar for the input string. We focus attention on the approximation ratio of the algorithm (and implicitly, the worst case behavior) to establish provable performance guarantees and to address shortcomings in the classical measure of redundancy in the literature. Our first results are concern the hardness of approximating the smallest grammar problem. Most notably, we show that every efficient algorithm for the smallest grammar problem has approximation ratio at least 8569/8568 unless P=NP. We then bound approximation ratios for several of the best known grammar-based compression algorithms, including LZ78, B ISECTION, SEQUENTIAL, LONGEST MATCH, GREEDY, and RE-PAIR. Among these, the best upper bound we show is O(n12/). We finish by presenting two novel algorithms with exponentially better ratios of O(log3n) and O(log(n/m*)), where m* is the size of the smallest grammar for that input. The latter algorithm highlights a connection between grammar-based compression and LZ77.\",\n",

PHera allows the users and content owners to dynamically establish trust using fine-grained access control. In P-Hera, resource owners can specify fine-grained restrictions on who can access their resources and which user can access which part of data. We differentiate our work with traditional works of fine-grained access control on Web services, as our system in addition to handling access constrains of the service provider (which is the case in Web services), it also handles security constrains regarding actions performed on data: replication and modification. We believe this is of immense significance for wide-range of applications such as data Grids, Information Grids and Web Content Delivery Networks. In addition to presenting the overall system architecture, we also study the problem of evaluating these fine-grained access policies in depth and propose a novel means of organizing these policies that can result in faster evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using prototype implementation.',\n",

However, wireless links are typically prone to bursts of errors, with characteristics which vary over time.We propose a wireless system suitable for real-time remote patient monitoring in which the necessary reliability and guaranteed latency are both achieved by an efficient error control scheme. We have paired an example remote electrocardiography application to this wireless system. We also developed a tool chain that uses a formal description of the proposed wireless medical system architecture in the architecture analysis and design language to assess various combinations of system parameters: we can determine the QoS in terms of packet-delivery ratio and the service latency, and also the size of jitter buffer required for seamless ECG monitoring. A realistic assessment, based on data from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia database, shows that the proposed wireless system can achieve an appropriate level of QoS for real-time ECG monitoring if link-level error control is correctly implemented. Additionally, we present guidelines for the design of energy-efficient link-level error control, derived from energy data, obtained from simulations.',\n",

       " 30: {'input_text': \" In relevance feedback of image retrieval, selective sampling is often used to alleviate the burden of labeling by selecting only the most informative data to label. Traditional data selection scheme often selects a batch of data at a time and label them all together, which neglects the data's correlation and thus jeopardizes the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Certainty Propagation (DCP) scheme for informative data selection. For each unlabeled data, we define the notion of certainty to quantify our confidence in its predicted label. Every time, we only label one single data point with the lowest degree of certainty. Then we update the rest unlabeled data's certainty dynamically according to their correlation. This one-by-one labeling offers us extra guidance from the last labeled data for the next labeling. Experiments show that the DCP scheme outperforms the traditional method evidently.\",\n",

       " 31: {'input_text': ' We consider the verification of safety (strict serializability and abort consistency) and liveness (obstruction and livelock freedom) for the hybrid transactional memory framework FlexTM. This framework allows for flexible implementations of transactional memories based on an adaptation of the MESI coherence protocol. FlexTM allows for both eager and lazy conflict resolution strategies. Like in the case of Software Transactional Memories, the verification problem is not trivial as the number of concurrent transactions, their size, and the number of accessed shared variables cannot be a priori bounded. This complexity is exacerbated by aspects that are specific to hardware and hybrid transactional memories. Our work takes into account intricate behaviours such as cache line based conflict detection, false sharing, invisible reads or non-transactional instructions. We carry out the first automatic verification of a hybrid transactional memory and establish, by adopting a small model approach, challenging properties such as strict serializability, abort consistency, and obstruction freedom for both an eager and a lazy conflict resolution strategies. We also detect an example that refutes livelock freedom. To achieve this, our prototype tool makes use of the latest antichain based techniques to handle systems with tens of thousands of states.',\n",

       " 32: {'input_text': ' In this work, we propose and assess a technique called bypass processing for optimizing the evaluation of disjunctive queries with expensive predicates. The technique is particularly useful for optimizing selection predicates that contain terms whose evaluation costs vary tremendously; e.g., the evaluation of a nested subquery or the invocation of a user-defined function in an object-oriented or extended relational model may be orders of magnitude more expensive than an attribute access (and comparison). The idea of bypass processing consists of avoiding the evaluation of such expensive terms whenever the outcome of the entire selection predicate can already be induced by testing other, less expensive terms. In order to validate the viability of bypass evaluation, we extend a previously developed optimizer architecture and incorporate three alternative optimization algorithms for generating bypass processing plans.',\n",

       " 33: {'input_text': ' In this paper, we design and evaluate SORS- a scalable online ridesharing system, where drivers and passengers send their requests for a ride in advance, possibly on a short notice. SORS is modular and consists of two main, loosely coupled, components: the Constraint Satisfier and the Matching Module. The Constraint Satisfier takes as input information about the desired trajectories and spatio-temporal constraints of drivers and passengers and it returns a list of feasible (driver, passenger) pairs. We use a road networks data structure, optimized for the specific spatio-temporal queries in the context of ridesharing, and we show that our Constraint Satisfier has a 4.65x more scalable query time than a general-purpose database. We represent the feasible pairs of drivers and passengers as a weighted bipartite graph with edge weight being the length of the shared trip of the pair, which captures the revenue in real-world ridesharing systems, such as Lyft Carpool. The Matching Module then takes as input this weighted bipartite graph and returns the maximum weighted matching (MWM), using an algorithm that solves the problem online and efficiently, by incrementally updating the matching solution in real-time. We show that our algorithm achieves 51% larger weight (i.e., total revenue) compared to greedy heuristics used by many real systems today. We also evaluate the SORS system as a whole, using mobile datasets to extract driver trajectories and passenger locations in urban environments. We show that SORS can provide a ridesharing recommendation to individual users within a sub-second query response time, even at high workloads.',\n",

This paper introduces an approximate analysis that fairly accurately predicts the hit ratio of the LRU policy in the case of short term correlations. The approximation approach is based on the relation between the working set model and LRU, while the request generation process is assumed to follow a recently proposed model for Web-traces, which captures short term correlations among the requests. The accuracy of the introduced approximate analysis is validated for synthetic as well as real Web-traces.',\n",

       " 35: {'input_text': ' An orthogonal drawing of a graph is a drawing such that nodes are placed on grid points and edges are drawn as sequences of vertical and horizontal segments. In this paper we present linear time algorithms that produce orthogonal drawings of graphs with n nodes. If the maximum degree is four, then the drawing produced by our algorithm needs area no greater than 0.8n\\n2 and no more than 1.9n bends. Notice that our upper bound on the bends is below the lower bound for planar orthogonal drawings of planar graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for orthogonal drawings that needs area less than n\\n2. If the maximum degree is three, then the drawing produced by our algorithm needs (n/2+1)×n/2 area and at most n/2+3 bends. These upper bounds match the upper bounds known for triconnected planar graphs of degree 3.',\n",

As a consequence, random testing would be rather unpredictable. We evaluate the variance of the number of faults detected by random testing over time. We present the results of an empirical study that is based on 1215 hours of randomly testing 27 Eiffel classes, each with 30 seeds of the random number generator. Analyzing over 6 million failures triggered during the experiments, the study provides evidence that the relative number of faults detected by random testing over time is predictable but that different runs of the random test case generator detect different faults. The study also shows that random testing quickly finds faults: the first failure is likely to be triggered within 30 seconds.',\n",

       " 38: {'input_text': ' The Network Simulator-3 (ns-3) is rapidly developing into a flexible and easy-to-use tool suitable for wireless network simulation. Since energy consumption is a key issue for wireless devices, wireless network researchers often need to investigate the energy consumption at a battery powered node or in the overall network, while running network simulations. This requires the underlying simulator to support energy consumption and energy source modeling. Currently however, ns-3 does not provide any support for modeling energy consumption or energy sources. In this paper, we introduce an integrated energy framework for ns-3, with models for energy source as well as energy consumption. We present the design and implementation of the overall framework and the specific models therein. Further, we show how the proposed framework can be used in ns-3 to simulate energy-aware protocols in a wireless network.',\n",

       " 39: {'input_text': ' We present a pioneering study on machine dating of manuscripts written by an individual. Analysis of handwriting style forms the core of the proposed method. A general framework is presented for automatic time stamping of handwritten manuscripts. Initially, it is hypothesized that a manuscript can be dated, to a certain level of accuracy, by looking at the way it is written. The hypothesis is then verified with real samples of known dates. Experiments on a database containing manuscripts of Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880), the famous French novelist, reports about 62% accuracy while dating the manuscripts within a range of five calendar years with respect to their exact year of writing.

       " 40: {'input_text': ' Performing random walks in networks is a fundamental primitive that has found numerous applications in communication networks such as token management, load balancing, network topology discovery and construction, search, and peer-to-peer membership management. While several such algorithms are ubiquitous, and use numerous random walk samples, the walks themselves have always been performed naively.In this paper, we focus on the problem of performing random walk sampling efficiently in a distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds and messages required to obtain several random walk samples in a continuous online fashion. We present the first round and message optimal distributed algorithms that present a significant improvement on all previous approaches. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations of our algorithms show that they perform very well in different types of networks of differing topologies.In particular, our results show how several random walks can be performed continuously (when source nodes are provided only at runtime, i.e., online), such that each walk of length ¿ can be performed exactly in just O ¿ ( ¿ D ) rounds11Throughout this paper, O ¿ hides polylogarithmic factors in the number of nodes in the network. (where D is the diameter of the network), and O ( ¿ ) messages. This significantly improves upon both, the naive technique that requires O ( ¿ ) rounds and O ( ¿ ) messages, and the sophisticated algorithm of Das Sarma et¿al. (2013) that has the same round complexity as this paper but requires ¿ ( m ¿ ) messages (where m is the number of edges in the network). Our theoretical results are corroborated through extensive simulations on various topological data sets. Our algorithms are fully decentralized, lightweight, and easily implementable, and can serve as building blocks in the design of topologically-aware networks. We consider the problem of sampling nodes through random walks in a distributed network.We present algorithm to compute several random walk samples in a continuous online fashion.Our algorithm minimizes (almost optimal) the number of rounds and messages.Our algorithm is effective and efficient as shown by experimental evaluation on various topological networks.Our algorithm performs very well on various metrics for all parameter ranges.',\n",

Recently, the subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradient method has been proposed to combine the advantages of two reigning paradigms, direct and iterative methods, to improve the efficiency of the solver. Yet the question of how to pick a good subgraph is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new metric to measure the quality of a spanning tree preconditioner based on support theory. We use this metric to develop an algorithm to find good subgraph preconditioners and apply them to solve the SLAM problem. The results show that although the proposed algorithm is not fast enough, the new metric is effective and resulting subgraph preconditioners significantly improve the efficiency of the state-of-the-art solver.',\n",

A 3D articulate human model with changeable size, color and surface shape is constructed and personalized to fit with a focused figure in the video.Either the personal model is then driven automatically or manually to match with the moving body in the consecutive image frames. This matching starts from key frames that contain key poses. A smooth motion is then interpolated in between key frames.

       " 43: {'input_text': ' The emergence of location-aware services calls for new real time spatio-temporal query processing algorithms that deal with large numbers of mobile objects and queries. Online query response is an important characterization of location-aware services. A delay in the answer to a query gives invalid and obsolete results, simply because moving objects can change their locations before the query responds. To handle large numbers of spatio-temporal queries efficiently, we propose the idea of sharing as a means to achieve scalability. In this paper, we introduce several types of sharing in the context of continuous spatio-temporal queries. Examples of sharing in the context of real-time spatio-temporal database systems include sharing the execution, sharing the underlying space, sharing the sliding time windows, and sharing the objects of interest. We demonstrate how sharing can be integrated into query predicates, e.g., selection and spatial join processing. The goal of this paper is to outline research directions and approaches that will lead to scalable and efficient location-aware services.',\n",

This includes, for example, the body of research papers in computer science, all news articles written in the US, and most people's personal email. However, we have only rather limited methods for analyzing and understanding these collections. While keyword-based retrieval systems allow efficient access to individual documents in archives, we still lack methods for understanding a corpus as a whole. In this paper, we explore methods that provide a temporal summary of such corpora in terms of landmark documents, authors, and topics. In particular, we explicitly model the temporal nature of influence between documents and re-interpret summarization as a coverage problem over words anchored in time. The resulting models provide monotone sub-modular objectives for computing informative and non-redundant summaries over time, which can be efficiently optimized with greedy algorithms. Our empirical study shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baselines.\",\n",

       " 45: {'input_text': \" The introduction of multicore processors on desktops and other personal computing platforms has given rise to multiple interesting end-user application possibilities. One important trend is the increased presence of resource hungry applications like gaming and multimedia applications. One of the key distinguishing factors of these applications is that they are amenable to variable semantics (ie, multiple possibilities of results) unlike traditional applications wherein a fixed, unique answer is expected. For example, varying degrees of image processing improves picture quality, different model complexities used in game physics allow different degrees of realism during game play, and so on. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that scalable semantics in applications such as video games can be enriched with optional tasks that can be launched and thus adapt to the amount of available resources at runtime. We propose a C/C++ API that allows the programmer to define how the current semantics of a program can be opportunistically enriched, as well as the underlying runtime system that orchestrates the different computations We show how this infrastructure can be used to enrich a well known game called Quake 3. Our results show that it is possible to perform significant enrichment without degrading the application's performance by utilizing additional cores.\",\n",

       " 47: {'input_text': ' In this paper, we improve the bounds for computing a network decomposition, which is a basic notion in distributed graph algorithms, distributively and deterministically. Our algorithm computes an $(n^{\\\\epsilon(n)},(n^{\\\\epsilon(n)})$-decomposition in $O(n^{\\\\epsilon(n)})$ time, where $\\\\epsilon(n)=O(1/ \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$. As a corollary we obtain improved deterministic bounds for distributively computing several graph structures such as maximal independent sets and $\\\\Delta$-vertex colorings. We also show that the class of graphs $\\\\cal G$ whose maximum degree is $O(n^{\\\\delta(n)})$, where $\\\\delta(n)=O(1/\\\\log \\\\log n)$, is complete for the task of computing a near-optimal decomposition, i.e., a $(\\\\log n \\\\log n)$-decomposition, in $O($polylog$(n))$ time. This is a corollary of a more general characterization, which pinpoints the weak points of existing network decomposition algorithms. Completeness is to be intended in the following sense: if we have an algorithm $\\\\cal A$ that computes an optimal decomposition in $O($polylog$(n))$ time for graphs in $\\\\cal G$, then we can compute an optimal decomposition in $O($polylog $(n))$ time for all graphs.',\n",

       " 48: {'input_text': ' The lack of good \"correlation\" between pre-silicon simulated delays and measured delays on silicon (silicon data) has spurred efforts on so-called silicon debug. The identification of speed-limiting paths, or simply speedpaths, in silicon debug is a crucial step, required for both \"fixing\" failing paths and for accurate learning from silicon data. We propose using characterized, pre-silicon, variational timing models to identify speedpaths that can best explain the observed delays from silicon measurements. Delays of all logic paths are written as affine functions of process parameters, called hyperplanes, and a branch and bound approach is then applied to find the \"best\" path combinations. Our method has been tested on a set of ISCAS-89 circuits and the results show that it accurately identifies the speedpaths in most cases, and that this is achieved in a very efficient manner.',\n",

       " 49: {'input_text': ' The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle deformation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand animation. We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressiveness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those created manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture system to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art-directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.',\n",

       " 50: {'input_text': \" Accurate simulation of light transport in participating media is expensive, due to the many scattering events. However, the band-limiting effect of scattering in media makes this kind of light transport very suitable for adaptive sampling and reconstruction techniques. In this work we present a novel algorithm that adaptively samples radiance from sparse points in the medium using up-to second-order occlusion-aware derivatives to determine when interpolation is appropriate. We derive our metric from each point's incoming light field. We use a proxy triangulation-based representation of the radiance reflected by the surrounding medium and geometry to efficiently compute the first- and second-order derivatives of the radiance at the cache points while accounting for occlusion changes. We validate the quality of our approach on a self-contained two-dimensional model for light transport in media. Then we show how our results generalize to practical three-dimensional scenarios, where we show much better results while reducing computation time up to a 30% compared to previous work.\",\n",

The systems proposed in several researches have been able to plan the walking motions of a humanoid on an uneven terrain. In this paper, we aim to design a planning system that can generate various types of motions for a humanoid with a unified planning approach. Based on our previous work, we add two additional motion abilities: leaping and moving obstacles into the system. In previous work, the order of moving obstacles is determined first, and then the corresponding paths for the pushing/pulling motions are generated. In this work, we take a unified approach that accounts for all types of motions at the same time. We have implemented a planning system with this unified approach for a humanoid moving in a layered virtual environment. Several simulation examples are demonstrated in this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of the system.',\n",

       " 52: {'input_text': ' A content-based tile retrieval system based on the underlying multispectral Markov random field representation is introduced. Single tiles are represented by our approved textural features derived from especially efficient Markovian statistics and supplemented with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features representing occasional tile inhomogeneities. Markovian features are on top of that also invariant to illumination colour and robust to illumination direction variations, therefore an arbitrary illuminated tiles do not negatively influence the retrieval result. The presented computer-aided tile consulting system retrieves tiles from recent tile production digital catalogues, so that the retrieved tiles have as similar pattern and/or colours to a query tile as possible. The system is verified on a large commercial tile database in a psychovisual experiment.',\n",

       " 54: {'input_text': ' Sentence structure is considered to be an important component of the overall linguistic quality of text. Yet few empirical studies have sought to characterize how and to what extent structural features determine fluency and linguistic quality. We report the results of experiments on the predictive power of syntactic phrasing statistics and other structural features for these aspects of text. Manual assessments of sentence fluency for machine translation evaluation and text quality for summarization evaluation are used as gold-standard. We find that many structural features related to phrase length are weakly but significantly correlated with fluency and classifiers based on the entire suite of structural features can achieve high accuracy in pairwise comparison of sentence fluency and in distinguishing machine translations from human translations. We also test the hypothesis that the learned models capture general fluency properties applicable to human-authored text. The results from our experiments do not support the hypothesis. At the same time structural features and models based on them prove to be robust for automatic evaluation of the linguistic quality of multidocument summaries.',\n",

       " 56: {'input_text': ' Selective regression testing strategies attempt to choose an appropriate subset of test cases from among a previously run test suite for a software system, based on information about the changes made to the system to create new versions. Although there has been a significant amount of research in recent years on the design of such strategies, there has been very little investigation of their cost-effectiveness. This paper presents some computationally efficient predictors of the cost-effectiveness of the two main classes of selective regression testing approaches. These predictors are computed from data about the coverage relationship between the system under test and its test suite. The paper then describes case studies in which these predictors were used to predict the cost-effectiveness of applying two different regression testing strategies to two software systems. In one case study, the TESTTUBE method selected an average of 88.1 percent of the available test cases in each version, while the predictor predicted that 87.3 percent of the test cases would be selected on average.',\n",

Both local and global consensus are defined and investigated. Techniques for studying the synchronization in such complex networks are exploited to establish various sufficient conditions for reaching consensus. The local consensus problem is first studied via a combination of the tools of complex analysis, local consensus manifold approach, and Lyapunov methods. A generalized algebraic connectivity is then proposed to study the global consensus problem in strongly connected networks and also in a broad class of networks containing spanning trees, for which ideas from algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and Lyapunov methods are utilized.',\n",

       " 58: {'input_text': \" We present a GPU based implementation of Reyes-style adaptive surface subdivision, known in Reyes terminology as the Bound/Split and Dice stages. The performance of this task is important for the Reyes pipeline to map efficiently to graphics hardware, but its recursive nature and irregular and unbounded memory requirements present a challenge to an efficient implementation. Our solution begins by characterizing Reyes subdivision as a work queue with irregular computation, targeted to a massively parallel GPU. We propose efficient solutions to these general problems by casting our solution in terms of the fundamental primitives of prefix-sum and reduction, often encountered in parallel and GPGPU environments. Our results indicate that real-time Reyes subdivision can indeed be obtained on today's GPUs. We are able to subdivide a complex model to subpixel accuracy within 15 ms. Our measured performance is several times better than that of Pixar's RenderMan. Our implementation scales well with the input size and depth of subdivision. We also address concerns of memory size and bandwidth, and analyze the feasibility of conventional ideas on screen-space buckets.\",\n",

Without adequate privacy protection, however, these systems can be easily misused, for example, to track users or target them for home invasion. In this paper, we introduce LocX, a novel alternative that provides significantly improved location privacy without adding uncertainty into query results or relying on strong assumptions about server security. Our key insight is to apply secure user-specific, distance-preserving coordinate transformations to all location data shared with the server. The friends of a user share this user's secrets so they can apply the same transformation. This allows all location queries to be evaluated correctly by the server, but our privacy mechanisms guarantee that servers are unable to see or infer the actual location data from the transformed data or from the data access. We show that LocX provides privacy even against a powerful adversary model, and we use prototype measurements to show that it provides privacy with very little performance overhead, making it suitable for today's mobile devices.\",\n",

       " 60: {'input_text': \" We propose a novel tracking algorithm based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo sampling method which efficiently deals with the abrupt motions. Abrupt motions could cause conventional tracking methods to fail since they violate the motion smoothness constraint. To address this problem, we introduce the Wang-Landau algorithm that has been recently proposed in statistical physics, and integrate this algorithm into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo based tracking method. Our tracking method alleviates the motion smoothness constraint utilizing both the likelihood term and the density of states term, which is estimated by the Wang-Landau algorithm. The likelihood term helps to improve the accuracy in tracking smooth motions, while the density of states term captures abrupt motions robustly. Experimental results reveal that our approach efficiently samples the object's states even in a whole state space without loss of time. Therefore, it tracks the object of which motion is drastically changing, accurately and robustly.\",\n",

       " 62: {'input_text': ' A modern technique for robotic sound source detection using a dataset Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) is presented. To ensure fast detection, the HRTFs are reduced using three different techniques, namely; Diffuse-Field Equalization, Balanced Model Truncation, and Principle Component Analysis. A new criterion introduced is to be satisfied by a set of output signals from the microphones of a dummy robot head. This criterion is then used to find the sound source location in accordance with the reduced HRTF datasets. The suggested method is verified through simulated examples and further tested in a household environment. This novel technique provides estimates of azimuth and elevation angles in free space by using only two microphones. It also uses a simple algorithm compared to the more complicated algorithms used in similar localization processes.',\n",

       " 64: {'input_text': ' SOAP has been widely adopted as a simple, robust and extensible XML-based protocol for the exchange of messages among web services. Unfortunately, SOAP communications have two major performance-related drawbacks: i) verbosity, related to XML, that leads to increased network traffic, and ii) high computational burden of XML parsing and processing, that leads to high latency. In this paper, we address these two issues and introduce a novel framework for Differential SOAP Multicasting (DSM). The main idea consists in identifying the common pattern and differences between SOAP messages, modeled as trees, so as to multicast similar messages together. Our method is based on the well known concept of Tree Edit Distance, built upon a novel filter-differencing architecture to reduce message aggregation time, identifying only those messages which are relevant (i.e., similar enough) for similarity evaluation. In addition, our technique exploits a dedicated differencing output format specifically designed to carry the minimum amount of diff information, in the multicast message, so as to minimize the multicast message size, and therefore reducing the network traffic. The battery of simulation experiments conducted to evaluate our approach shows the relevance of our method in comparison with traditional and dedicated multicasting techniques.',\n",

This may become tedious if the data happens to be a 3-D scene of which a part of the differentiating features of a structure is buried in 3-D contextual information. We propose a concept of extending interactive or semi-automatic segmentation to 3-D where coherence information may be exploited more efficiently. A non-analysed scene may be evaluated using volume rendering techniques with which the user interacts to extract the structures that he or she is interested in. The approach is based on a concept of a co-operative system that communicates with the user for finding the best rendition and analysis. Within the concept we present a new method of estimating rendering parameters if the object of interest is only partially analysed.',\n",

       " 68: {'input_text': \" CONTEXT: Systematic literature reviews largely rely upon using the titles and abstracts of primary studies as the basis for determining their relevance. However, our experience indicates that the abstracts for software engineering papers are frequently of such poor quality they cannot be used to determine the relevance of papers. Both medicine and psychology recommend the use of structured abstracts to improve the quality of abstracts. AIM: This study investigates whether structured abstracts are more complete and easier to understand than non-structured abstracts for software engineering papers that describe experiments. METHOD: We constructed structured abstracts for a random selection of 25 papers describing software engineering experiments. The original abstract was assessed for clarity (assessed subjectively on a scale of 1 to 10) and completeness (measured with a questionnaire of 18 items) by the researcher who constructed the structured version. The structured abstract was reviewed for clarity and completeness by another member of the research team. We used a paired 't' test to compare the word length, clarity and completeness of the original and structured abstracts. RESULTS: The structured abstracts were significantly longer than the original abstracts (size difference =106.4 words with 95% confidence interval 78.1 to 134.7). However, the structured abstracts had a higher clarity score (clarity difference= 1.47 with 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 2.41) and were more complete (completeness difference=3.39 with 95% confidence intervals 4.76 to 7.56). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with previous research on structured abstracts. However, in this study, the subjective estimates of completeness and clarity were made by the research team. Future work will solicit assessments of the structured and original abstracts from independent sources (students and researchers).\",\n",

       " 72: {'input_text': ' Boltzmann machines are undirected graphical models with two-state stochastic variables, in which the logarithms of the clique potentials are quadratic functions of the node states. They have been widely studied in the neural computing literature, although their practical applicability has been limited by the difficulty of finding an effective learning algorithm. One well-established approach, known as mean field theory, represents the stochastic distribution using a factorized approximation. However, the corresponding learning algorithm often fails to find a good solution. We conjecture that this is due to the implicit uni-modality of the mean field approximation which is therefore unable to capture multi-modality in the true distribution. In this paper we use variational methods to approximate the stochastic distribution using multi-modal mixtures of factorized distributions. We present results for both inference and learning to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.',\n",

       " 76: {'input_text': \" During the last decade, the number of functions of automotive user interfaces has increased rapidly. Besides traditional controls to drive a car, driver assistance, infotainment, entertainment, and comfort systems need to be controlled while driving. This does not only affect the driver's cognitive workload but also leads to increased complexity in designing automotive user interfaces. In this paper, we provide models and tools for rapid prototyping and the evaluation of user interfaces in this context. Usually, functional prototypes of user interfaces are implemented that allow the usability and quality to be assessed with time-consuming user studies. In contrast, in our approach we use an adapted Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) that is based on empirically collected data for typical operations in the car. It takes into account the aspect of attention switching in the car between primary tasks and other tasks. We present KLM operator times that we determined in a user study as well as a formula for estimating the task completion time. The presented model is the foundation for the MI-AUI prototyping tool that we implemented for permitting the creation of automotive interfaces using tangible controls. By demonstrating a typical operation with the MI-AUI prototype, the estimated task completion time can be calculated. MI-AUI is an evaluation tool that can be quickly and easily applied in early stages of the design process without the need to involve real drivers.\",\n",

       " 77: {'input_text': ' Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities. The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts.',\n",

       " 79: {'input_text': \" Monitoring aquatic debris is of great interest to the ecosystems, marine life, human health, and water transport. This paper presents the design and implementation of SOAR-a vision-based surveillance robot system that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a gliding robotic fish for debris monitoring in relatively calm waters. SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage for sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload compute-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation. We have implemented a SOAR prototype and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. The results show that SOAR can accurately detect debris in the presence of various environment and system dynamics, and the rotation scheduling algorithm enables SOAR to capture debris arrivals with reduced energy consumption.\",\n",

       " 82: {'input_text': \" Large-scale donation-based distributed infrastructures need to cope with the inherent unreliability of participant nodes. A widely-used work scheduling technique in such en- vironments is to redundantly schedule the outsourced com- putations to a number of nodes. We present the design and implementation of RIDGE, a reliability-aware system which uses a node's prior performance and behavior to make more effective scheduling decisions. We have imple- mented RIDGE on top of the BOINC distributed comput- ing infrastructure and have evaluated its performance on a live PlanetLab testbed. Our experimental results show that RIDGE is able to match or surpass the throughput of the best BOINC configuration by automatically adapting to the characteristics of the underlying environment. In additio n, RIDGE is able to provide much lower workunit makespans compared to BOINC. RIDGE is also able to produce signif- icantly lower communication makespans for downloading clients. Collectively, the results suggest that RIDGE has great promise for service-oriented environments with time constraints. putation and communication performance of the nodes. These problems arise as nodes have dynamically changing workloads, may leave and join unexpectedly, and may be- have maliciously. When nodes are serving data, their ex- treme time-varying heterogeneity in terms of different ca- pacity, bandwidth, and latency can also compromise perfor- mance. For the first problem, we present a scheme that can dynamically adjust the degree of replication based on the current node behavior. In an earlier paper, we showed how intelligent replication can improve performance through a simulation study (9). This paper focuses on the implemen- tation and deployment of the proposed ideas in a live envi- ronment. For the second problem, we present a scheme that can dynamically select the most appropriate nodes for data download based on current network dynamics. The key contribution is that clients can make independent download decisions from replicated data nodes without direct intera c- tion and minimal state. We have deployed a prototype of RIDGE and evaluated it on a live distributed testbed on PlanetLab (3), using the BLAST (4) bioinformatics application. The results show that RIDGE can automatically match, and in some cases surpass, the best static BOINC performance (which requires knowing the dynamics of the environment) in terms of re- liability, and can achieve far better computation makespan. The results also show that communication makespan can be significantly reduced using our schemes (17-43% improve- ment over existing heuristics). Collectively, these resul ts indicate that RIDGE is well-suited to service-oriented envi- ronments with time constraints.\",\n",

We subse- quently explore four novel approaches to flnding globally- optimal NMF solutions using various ideas from convex op- timization. We then develop a new method, isometric NMF (isoNMF), which preserves non-negativity while also provid- ing an isometric embedding, simultaneously achieving two properties which are helpful for interpretation. Though it results in a more di-cult optimization problem, we show ex- perimentally that the resulting method is scalable and even achieves more compact spectra than standard NMF.',\n",

In particular, humanoid robots should learn new skills incrementally through autonomous exploration, and adapt to different contexts. In this paper we consider the problem of learning forward models for task space control under dynamically varying kinematic contexts: the robot learns incrementally and autonomously its forward kinematics under different contexts, represented by the inclusion of different tools, and exploits the learned model to realize reaching with those tools. We model the forward kinematics as a multi-valued function, in which different outputs for the same input query are related to different tools (i.e. contexts). The model is estimated using IMLE, a recent online learning algorithm for multi-valued regression, and used for control. No information is given about the tool changes, nor any assumption is made about the tool kinematics. Results are provided both in simulation and with a full-body humanoid. In the latter case we show how the robot successfully performs reaching using a flexible tool, a clear example of complex kinematics.',\n",

       " 85: {'input_text': ' Computing the Euler genus of a graph is a fundamental problem in graph theory and topology. It has been shown to be NP-hard by Thomassen [27] and a linear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by Mohar [20]. Despite extensive study, the approximability of the Euler genus remains wide open. While the existence of a constant factor approximation is not ruled out, the currently best-known upper bound is a trivial O(n/g)-approximation that follows from bounds on the Euler characteristic. In this paper, we give the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this problem. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm which given a graph G of Euler genus g outputs an embedding of G into a surface of Euler genus gO(1). Combined with the above O(n/g)-approximation, our result also implies a O(n1-α)-approximation, for some universal constant α> 0. Our approximation algorithm also has implications for the design of algorithms on graphs of small genus. Several of these algorithms require that an embedding of the graph into a surface of small genus is given as part of the input. Our result implies that many of these algorithms can be implemented even when the embedding of the input graph is unknown.',\n",

We show that for a pair of corresponding conics, the parameters representing the conics satisfy a linear constraint. To be more specific, the parameters that represent a conic in one image are transformed by a five-dimensional projective transformation to the parameters that represent the corresponding conic in another image. We also show that this transformation is expressed as the symmetric component of the tensor product of the transformation based on point/line correspondences and itself. In addition, we present a linear algorithm for uniquely determining the corresponding point-based transformation from a given conic-based transformation up to a scale factor. Accordingly, conic correspondences enable us to easily handle both points and lines in uncalibrated images of a planar object.',\n",

Yet we also know that digital information is becoming increasingly important to households. The problem is that this digital information is almost always tied to traditional computer displays, which inhibits its incorporation into household routines. Our solution, location-dependent information appliances, exploit both home location and context (as articulated in ethnographic studies) to enhance the role of ambient displays in the home setting; these displays provide home occupants with both background awareness of an information source and foreground methods to gain further details if desired. The novel aspect is that home occupants assign particular information to locations within a home in a way that makes sense to them. As a device is moved to a particular home location, information is automatically mapped to that device along with hints on how it should be displayed.',\n",

       " 91: {'input_text': ' Model-checkers have recently been suggested for automated software test-case generation. Several works have presented methods that create efficient test-suites using model-checkers. Ease of use and complete automation are major advantages of such approaches. However, the use of a model-checker comes at the price of potential performance problems. If the model used for test-case generation is complex, then model-checker based approaches can be very slow, or even not applicable at all. In this paper, we identify that unnecessary, redundant calls to the model-checker are one of the causes of bad performance. To overcome this problem, we suggest the use of temporal logic rewriting techniques, which originate from runtime verification research. This achieves a significant increase in the performance, and improves the applicability of model-checker based test-case generation approaches in general. At the same time, the suggested techniques achieve a reduction of the resulting test-suite sizes without degradation of the fault sensitivity. This helps to reduce the costs of the test-case execution.',\n",

       " 92: {'input_text': ' Several recently-proposed architectures for high-performance object recognition are composed of two main stages: a feature extraction stage that extracts locally-invariant feature vectors from regularly spaced image patches, and a somewhat generic supervised classifier. The first stage is often composed of three main modules: (1) a bank of filters (often oriented edge detectors); (2) a non-linear transform, such as a point-wise squashing functions, quantization, or normalization; (3) a spatial pooling operation which combines the outputs of similar filters over neighboring regions. We propose a method that automatically learns such feature extractors in an unsupervised fashion by simultaneously learning the filters and the pooling units that combine multiple filter outputs together. The method automatically generates topographic maps of similar filters that extract features of orientations, scales, and positions. These similar filters are pooled together, producing locally-invariant outputs. The learned feature descriptors give comparable results as SIFT on image recognition tasks for which SIFT is well suited, and better results than SIFT on tasks for which SIFT is less well suited.',\n",

       " 93: {'input_text': ' The emergence of the World Wide Web and its influence on the fields of industry, commerce, healthcare and so on, has led to an innovative, dynamic, open, collaborative and interactive environment – the digital ecosystem. Whereas service plays an important role in digital ecosystems, there is no technology available to retrieve heterogeneous and geographically dispersed services. Additionally, no methodology has been proposed in the literature that can distinguish or rank the services based on the Quality of Services (QoS). In order to address these issues, we propose a semantic service retrieval engine which incorporates a novel semantic QoS evaluation methodology. The salient feature of this methodology that sets it apart from any other QoS evaluation methodologies is that the evaluation of the service and the subsequent quantification of QoS is a combination of subjective and objective QoS measures. Another salient feature of our proposed methodology is that it enables the domain-specific ranking of services. Finally, an online prototype is implemented to evaluate our methodology, the results of which are discussed in this paper.',\n",

The platform was primarily used for uploading field notes from students' ethnographic work. We describe the use of the wiki in terms of how it supported orientations among students towards relevant competencies involved in fieldwork, and how teachers used it as a way of gaining access to students' work. We discuss these functionalities in relation to ethnomethodological work on learning-and-instruction, showing how wiki entries were used as references in students' and teachers' talk. Distributed activities were thereby made available for instructive practices, and the competencies involved in note taking and observation could be collaboratively oriented to. We thus show that although the wiki was a web based distributed tool, its primary pedagogical functionality lay in its being used as a resource in co-located face-to-face talk.\",\n",

       " 98: {'input_text': ' The fast global k-means (FGKM) clustering algorithm is one of the most effective approaches for resolving the local convergence of the k-means clustering algorithm. Numerical experiments show that it can effectively determine a global or near global minimizer of the cost function. However, the FGKM algorithm needs a large amount of computational time or storage space when handling large data sets. To overcome this deficiency, a more efficient FGKM algorithm, namely FGKM+A, is developed in this paper. In the development, we first apply local geometrical information to describe approximately the set of objects represented by a candidate cluster center. On the basis of the approximate description, we then propose an acceleration mechanism for the production of new cluster centers. As a result of the acceleration, the FGKM+A algorithm not only yields the same clustering results as that of the FGKM algorithm but also requires less computational time and fewer distance calculations than the FGKM algorithm and its existing modifications. The efficiency of the FGKM+A algorithm is further confirmed by experimental studies on several UCI data sets.',\n",

One of the reasons why schemata are still rare is the effort required to create them. Consequently, numerous ontology learning approaches have been developed to simplify the creation of schemata. Those approaches usually either learn structures from text or existing RDF data. In this submission, we present the first approach combining both sources of evidence, in particular we combine an existing logical learning approach with statistical relevance measures applied on textual resources. We perform an experiment involving a manual evaluation on 100 classes of the DBpedia 3.9 dataset and show that the inclusion of relevance measures leads to a significant improvement of the accuracy over the baseline algorithm.',\n",
